# INTERSHIP_Tasks

-INTRODUCTION :
This repository contains Java-based implementations of various tasks assigned to me during my CodSoft internship. The tasks cover a range of programming concepts, including control structures, object-oriented programming, and user interaction, all designed to strengthen my skills in software development.

-TASKS_OVER-VIEW :

Task 1: Number Game

Objective:
Develop a Java program for a number guessing game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range (e.g. 1 to 100).

Task 2: Student Grade Calculator

Objective:
Create a Java program to calculate a student's grades based on the marks obtained in various subjects.

Task 3: ATM Interface

Objective:
Develop a Java-based ATM interface that allows users to perform basic banking operations like withdrawing, depositing, and checking the balance.

-TECHNOLOGY_USED :

Programming Language: Java

Tools: Command Line Interface, Java Development Kit (JDK)

Concepts: Object-Oriented Programming, Control Structures, Input Validation

-CONCLUSION :
Completing these tasks during my CodSoft internship provided me with valuable experience in Java programming. I gained a deeper understanding of coding best practices, object-oriented design, and user interaction.
